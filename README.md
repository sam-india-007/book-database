This absolutely does not work, do not bother trying it.

Major issues:
1. I could not find a way to use CSV files with JS. All solutions used Node, not plain JS. The 'solutions' using plain JS did not work
2. I could not find hashing password techniques in JS. Everywhere I read, client-side hashing was strongly discouraged.

Seniors, any and all help will be much apprciated. Thank you.
